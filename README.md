# Password Generator

## Description

This project is a password generator. It contains JavaScript code that enables the application to randomly generate a password containing the criteria the user selects. 

The user has the choice of making the password contain 8-128 characters. The user can also select from the following criteria: 
* Lowercase letters
* Uppercase letters
* Numbers
* Special characters

Once the user selects the "generate password" button, the application will then prompt the user to select which criteria they would like in their password. The password is then displayed in the text area.
